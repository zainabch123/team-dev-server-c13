# Team Simulation - Server
Developed as part of a team simulation, this social-media-style app enables users to interact with teachers and students within their cohort. Key areas I contributed to include:

1. Updated the app's context to ensure essential user data is accessible throughout the UI, even after page refreshes.
2. Implemented user registration, allowing new users to register and create their initial profiles.
3. Developed functionality for users to view their own profiles and the profiles of others.
4. Enabled students to edit their profiles, while teachers can edit any profile and manage user permissions using role-based access control.
5. Updated the API using .yaml whenver changes were made.

An integral aspect of this team development simulation was the use of Agile methodologies. This included regular stand-ups, retrospectives, and reporting to a Scrum Master. The process involved breaking down client specifications from Figma into actionable tasks, which were organized into tickets for the team to prioritize and plan effectively. It was a highly valuable experience in collaboration and real-world coding practices.
